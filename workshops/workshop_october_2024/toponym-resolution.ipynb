    "# Toponym Resolution with T-Res\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the T-Res HTTP API for performing toponym resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toponym resolution refers to the task of identifying place names (toponyms) in a piece of text and linking each of them to a known physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves three distinct steps:\n",
    " 1. **named entity recognition** to identify which characters in the text are in fact toponyms\n",
    " 1. **candidate selection** to generate a list of candidate places within a knowledge base\n",
    " 1. **entity linking** to determine which candidate place is the best match for the given toponym\n",
    "\n",
    "[T-Res](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/T-Res) is a software tool that provides an end-to-end pipeline for toponym resolution, using [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) as its knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-Res HTTP API enables users to make toponym resolution queries to a remote server via an HTTP connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the examples in this notebook a server must be available to handle the API requests. During the workshop, such a server will be provided with the host IP address given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical documentation on T-Res can be found [here](https://living-with-machines.github.io/T-Res/index.html). Developers may also find the [API docs](http://20.0.184.45:8000/v2/t-res_deezy_reldisamb-wpubl-wmtops/docs) useful."
